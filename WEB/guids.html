        <h5>Usage Of</h5>
        <h2>First Aid</h2>
        <p><span>>Ensure Safety:</span> Your safety comes first. Make sure the immediate area is as secure as possible, and be aware of any ongoing threats or attacks. If it's not safe, it may be best to seek cover and wait for an opportunity to provide aid.
            <br><span>>Assess the Situation:</span> Approach the injured person cautiously. If they are in a dangerous area, try to move them to a safer location if it is feasible and safe to do so.
            <br><span>>Control Bleeding:</span> If the injured person is bleeding, use any available clean cloth or clothing to apply direct pressure to the wound. If possible, elevate the injured limb. Use a tourniquet as a last resort if bleeding cannot be controlled.
            <br><span>>Check for Breathing and Airway:</span> If the injured person is unconscious or not breathing, perform CPR if you are trained to do so.
            <br><span>>Stabilize Injuries:</span> If you suspect fractures or spinal injuries, do your best to immobilize the injured person. Use makeshift splints or support.
            <br><span>>Keep the Injured Person Calm:</span> Offer reassurance and emotional support. Stress can exacerbate injuries.
            <br><span>>Dress Wounds:</span> If you have access to clean materials, dress wounds to reduce the risk of infection.
            <br><span>>Stay Hidden:</span> If the situation remains dangerous, do not draw attention to yourself. You may need to hide and wait for a safer time to seek help.
            <br><span>>Signal for Help:</span> Use any available means to signal for help, such as creating visible markers or sounds. Be cautious about drawing the attention of hostile forces.
            <br><span>>Evacuate if Possible:</span> If it becomes safe to move the injured person, attempt to evacuate them to a safer location or seek help from local authorities or medical personnel if they are available.</p>

        <h5>Procedures For</h5>
        <h2>Evacuating</h2>
        <p><span>>Early Warning Systems:</span> In conflict areas, it may be difficult to rely on traditional warning systems. Pay attention to any available sources of information, such as news reports, community alerts, or the advice of local authorities and humanitarian organizations.
        <br><span>>Escape Routes:</span> Be aware of potential escape routes and safe corridors. Some areas may have established evacuation routes to designated safe zones or refugee camps.
        <br><span>>Safe Havens:</span> Identify and seek information about safe havens or areas where you can find relative safety. This might include underground shelters, community centers, or areas protected by international organizations.
        <br><span>>Travel Light:</span> In wartime, mobility is critical. Prepare a lightweight emergency kit with essentials like food, water, first aid supplies, important documents, and clothing. Minimize the items you carry to stay agile.</p>
